Hence, \\(Y_{i}\\) is a random variable Since \\(E(\\varepsilon_{i}) = 0\\), \\(E(Y_{i}) = E(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}X_{i} + \\varepsilon_{i}) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}X_{i} + E(\\varepsilon_{i}) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}X_{i}\\) The response \\(Y_{i}\\) in the ith trail exceeds or falls short of the value of the regssion fucntion by the error term amount \\(\\varepsilon_{i}\\) The erorr term \\(\\varepsilon_{i}\\) are assumed to have constant variance \\(\\sigma^{2}\\) and \\(\\sigma^{2}(Y_{i}) = \\sigma^{2}\\) The error terms are assumed to be uncorrelated, so are the responses \\(Y_{i}\\) and \\(Y_{j}\\) Meaning of regression paramters regrssion coefficients: the paramters \\(\\beta_{0}\\text{ and }\\beta_{1}\\) the slope of the regression line: \\(\\beta_{1}\\) Alternative versions of regression model \\[Y_{i} = \\beta_{0}X_{0} + \\beta_{1}X_{i} + \\varepsilon_{i}\\text{, where }X_{0} \\equiv 1\\] \\[Y_{i} = \\beta_{0}^{*} + \\beta_{1}(X_{i} - \\bar{X}) + \\varepsilon_{i}\\text{, where }\\beta_{0}^{*} = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\bar{X}\\] 2.4 Data for regression analysis Observational Data Eperimental Data treatment experimental units Completely randomized design 2.5 Overview of steps in regression analysis 2.6 Estimation of regression function Methods of Least Squares To find estimates \\(b_{0}\\) and \\(b_{1}\\) for \\(\\beta_{0}\\) and \\(\\beta_{1}\\), respectively, for which Q is a minimum, where \\(Q = \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(Y_{i} - \\beta_{0} - \\beta_{1}X_{i})^2\\). Least Squares Estimators \\(b_{0}\\) and \\(b_{1}\\) can be found in two ways: numerical search procedures analytical procedures \\[b_{1} = \\frac{\\sum(X_{i} - \\bar{X})(Y_{i} - \\bar{Y})}{\\sum(X_{i} - \\bar{X})^2}\\] \\[b_{0} = \\frac{1}{n}(\\sum Y_{i} - b_{1} \\sum X_{i}) = \\bar{Y} - b_{1}\\bar{X}\\] Proof The paritial derivatives are \\[\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial\\beta_{0}} = -2\\sum(Y_{i} - \\beta_{0} - \\beta_{1}X_{i})\\] \\[\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial\\beta_{1}} = -2\\sum X_{i}(Y_{i} - \\beta_{0} - \\beta_{1}X_{i})\\] We set them equal to zero, using \\(b_{0}\\) and \\(b_{1}\\) to denote the particular values of \\(b_{0}\\) and \\(b_{1}\\) that minimize Q: \\[-2\\sum(Y_{i} - \\beta_{0} - \\beta_{1}X_{i}) = 0\\] \\[-2\\sum X_{i}(Y_{i} - \\beta_{0} - \\beta_{1}X_{i}) = 0\\] Proerties of Least Squares Estimators Guass-Markov theorem: Under the conditions of regression model, the least squares estimators b0 and b1 are unbiased and have minimum variance among all unbiased linear estimators Point Esitmation of Mean Response estimate the regression function as follows: \\[\\hat{Y} = b_{0} + b_{1}X\\] Residuals residual: the differenc between the observed value \\(Y_{i}\\) and the corresponding fitted value \\(\\hat{Y_{i}}\\) \\[e_{i} = Y_{i} - \\hat{Y}_{i}\\] Properties of Fitted Regression Line \\(\\sum e_{i} = 0\\) \\(\\sum e_{i}^{2}\\) is a minimum \\(\\sum Y_{i} = \\sum \\hat{Y}_{i}\\) \\(\\sum X_{i} e_{i} = 0\\) \\(\\sum \\hat{Y}_{i}\\)ei = 0 the regression line always goes through the point \\((\\bar{X}, \\bar{Y})\\) 2.7 Estimation of Erro Terms Variance \\(\\sigma^{2}\\) Point Estimator of \\(\\sigma^{2}\\) Single population sum of squares: \\(\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(Y_{i}-\\bar{Y})^2\\) degrees of freedom (df): n - 1, because one degree of freedom is lost by using \\(\\bar{Y}\\) as an estimate of the unknown population mean \\(\\mu\\) sample variance/mean square: \\(s^2 = \\frac{\\displaystyle\\sum(Y_{i}-\\bar{Y})^2}{n-1}\\) Regression model deviation/residual: \\(Y_{i} - \\hat{Y}_{i}\\) = ei error/residual sum of squares: \\(SSE = \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(Y_{i} - \\hat{Y}_{i})^{2}\\) \\(SSE = \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n}e_{i}^{2}\\) degrees of freedom: n - 2, because two degrees of freedom are lost due to estimating \\(\\beta_{0}\\) and \\(\\beta_{1}\\) to get \\(\\hat{Y}_{i}\\) MSE (error/residual mean square): \\(s^{2} = MSE = \\frac{SSE}{n-2}\\) \\(E(MSE) = \\sigma^2\\) (Note: \\(SSE/\\sigma^2 \\sim \\chi^2(n-2)\\)), so MSE is an unbiased estimator of \\(\\sigma^2\\) 2.8 Normal Error Regression Model Model same with simple linear regression model except it assumes that the error \\(\\varepsilon_{i}\\) are normally distributed Estimation of Parameters by Method of Maximum Likelihood Method of maximum likelihood chooses as estimates those values of the parameters that are most consistent with the sample data. A normal distribution with SD = 10, mean is unknown A random of sample n = 3 yields the results 250, 265 and 259 The likelihood value (L) is the product of the densities of the normal distribution If we assue μ = 230, L(μ = 230) = 0.279*10E-9 R code: prod(dnorm(c(250,265,259), 230, 10)) If we assue μ = 259, L(μ = 259) = 0.0000354 R code: prod(dnorm(c(250,265,259), 259, 10)) So, L(μ = 259) &gt; L(μ = 230) The method of maximum likelihood is to estimate prarametes to get maximum L. It can be shown that for a normal population, the maximum likelihood estimator of μ is the smaple mean For regression model, the likelihood function for n observations is \\[L(\\beta_{0}, \\beta_{1}, \\sigma^{2}) = \\displaystyle\\Pi_{i=1}^{n}\\frac{1}{(2\\pi\\sigma^{2})^{1/2}}exp[-\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^{2}}(Y_{i} - \\beta_{0} - \\beta_{1}X_{i})^{2}]\\] \\[= \\frac{1}{(2\\pi\\sigma^{2})^{1/2}}exp[-\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(Y_{i} - \\beta_{0} - \\beta_{1}X_{i})^{2}]\\] So we can get the maximu likelihood estimator: Parameter Maximum Likelihood Estimator \\(\\beta_0\\) \\(\\hat{\\beta_0} = b_0\\) \\(\\beta_1\\) \\(\\hat{\\beta_1} = b_1\\) \\(\\sigma^2\\) \\(\\hat{\\sigma^2} = \\frac{\\sum(Y_i-\\hat{Y_i})^2}{n}\\) The maximum likelihood estimator \\(\\sigma^2\\) is biased.

Specifically, the power is given by \\[Power = P(|t^{*}| &gt; t(1-\\alpha/2;n-2)|\\delta)\\] where, \\(H_{0}: \\beta_{1} = \\beta_{10}\\); \\(H_{a}: \\beta_{1} \\neq \\beta_{10}\\) \\(t^{*} = \\frac{b_{1} - \\beta_{10}}{s(b_{1})}\\) \\(\\delta\\) is the noncentrality measure, a measure of how far the true value of \\(\\beta_{1}\\) is from \\(\\beta_{10}\\). \\(\\delta = \\frac{\\mid\\beta_{1} - \\beta_{10}\\mid}{\\sigma(b_{1})}\\) 3.4 Interval Estimation of \\(E(Y_{h})\\) The mean response when \\(X = X_{h}\\) is denoted by \\(E(Y_{h})\\). The \\(E(Y_{h})\\) point estimator \\(\\hat{Y}_{h}\\) : \\[\\hat{Y}_{h} = b_{0} + b_{1}X_{h}\\] Sampling Distribution of \\(\\hat{Y}_{h}\\) For normal error regression model, the sampling distribution of \\(\\hat{Y}_{h}\\) is normal, with mean and variance: \\[E(\\hat{Y}_{h}) = E(Y_{h})\\] \\[\\sigma^{2}(\\hat{Y}_{h}) = \\sigma^{2}[\\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{(X_{h} - \\bar{X})^2}{\\sum(X_{i} - \\bar{X})^{2}}]\\] \\[s^{2}(\\hat{Y}_{h}) = MSE[\\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{(X_{h} - \\bar{X})^{2}}{\\sum (X_{i} - \\bar{X})^{2}}]\\] \\[\\frac{\\hat{Y}_{h} - E(Y_{h})}{s(\\hat{Y}_{h})} \\sim t(n-2)\\] 3.5 Prediction of New Observation We denote the level of X for the new trial as \\(X_{h}\\) and the new observation on Y as \\(Y_{h(new)}\\). In the former case, the estimation of \\(E(Y_{h})\\) is the mean of the distribution of Y; in the present case, we predict an individual outcome draw from the distribution of Y. Hence, two components of \\(\\sigma(pred)\\): The variance of the distribution of Y at \\(X = X_{h}\\), namely \\(\\sigma^{2}\\) The variance of the sampling distribution of \\(\\hat{Y}_h\\), namely \\(\\sigma^{2}(\\hat{Y}_h)\\) \\[\\sigma^{2}(pred) = \\sigma^{2}(Y_{h(new)} - \\hat{Y}_{h}) = \\sigma^{2} + \\sigma^{2}(\\hat{Y}_{h})\\] \\[s^{2}(pred) = MSE[1 + \\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{(X_{h} - \\bar{X})^{2}}{\\sum (X_{i} - \\bar{X})^{2}}]\\] 3.6 Confidence Band for Regression Line To obtain a confidence band for the entire for the entire regression line \\(E(Y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}X\\). The Working-Hotellling 1 - \\(\\alpha\\) confidence band: \\[\\hat{Y}_{h} \\pm Ws(\\hat{Y}_{h})\\] where, \\[W^{2} = 2F(1-\\alpha; 2, n-2)\\] Since, we are doing all values of \\(X_{h}\\) at once, it will be wider at each \\(X_{h}\\) than CIs for individual \\(X_{h}\\). 3.7 Analysis of Variance Approach Partitioning of Total Sum of Squares \\[Y_{i} - \\bar{Y} = \\hat{Y}_{i} - \\bar{Y} + Y_{i} - \\hat{Y}_{i}\\] \\[\\sum (Y_{i} - \\bar{Y})^{2} = \\sum (\\hat{Y}_{i} - \\bar{Y})^{2} + \\sum (Y_{i} - \\hat{Y}_{i})^{2}\\] \\[SSTO = SSR + SSE\\] SSTO stands for total sum of squares, SSE stands for error sum of squares and SSR stands for regression sum of squares. Breakdown of Degrees of Freedom \\[n - 1 = 1 + (n - 2)\\] We have n-1 degrees of freedom associated with SSTO. SSE has n-2 degrees of freedom and SSR has 1 degree of freedom. Mean Squares A sum of squares divided by its associated degrees of freedom is called a mean square (MS) The mean squares are not additive: \\(\\frac{SSTO}{n-1} \\neq \\frac{SSR}{1} + \\frac{SSE}{n-2} = MSR + MSE\\) ANalysis Of VAriance Table (ANOVA table) ANOVA table: The breakdowns of the total sum of squares and associated degrees of freedom are displayed in the form of ANVOA.

The basic steps in summary form are: Fit the full model and obtain the error sum of squares SSE(F) Fit the reduced model under H0 and obtain the error sum of squares SSE(R) Use the test statistic and desicison rule 3.9 Descriptive Measures of Linear Association between X and Y Coefficient of Determination \\[R^2 = \\frac{SSR}{SSTO} = 1 - \\frac{SSE}{SSTO}, 0 \\leq R^2 \\leq 1\\] Limitations of \\(R^2\\) Tree common misunderstandings about \\(R^2\\) A high coefficient of determination indicates that useful predictions can be made. A high coefficient of determination indicates that the estimated regression line is a good fit. A coefficient of determination near zero indicates that X and Y are not related.

AI = IA = A, \\(A, I \\in \\mathbb{R}^{r \\times r}\\) Scalar Matrix: a diagonal matrix whose main-diagonal elements are the same, can be expressed as kI Vector and matrix with all elements unity a column vector with all elements 1 will be denoted by 1 a square matrix with all elements 1 will be denoted by J 1’1 = n 11’ = J Zero Vector: a vector containing only zeros, denoted by 0 6.5 Linear Dependence and Rank of Matrix Linear dependence We define the set of c column vectors \\(C_{1}, ..., C_{c}\\) in an r \\(\\times\\) c matrix to be linearly dependent if one vector can be expressed as a linear combination of others. If no vector in the set can be so expressed, we define the set of vectors to be linearly independent. In a more general, when c scalars \\(k_{1},...,k_{c}\\), not all zero, can be found such that: \\[k_{1}\\mathbf{C_{1}} + k_{2}\\mathbf{C_{2}} + ... + k_{c}\\mathbf{C_{c}} = \\mathbf{0}\\] where 0 denotes the zero column vector, the c column vectors are linearly dependent. If the only set of scalars for which the equality holds is \\(k_{1} = k_{2} = ... = k_{c} = 0\\), the set of c column vectors is linearly independent. Rank of Matrix: the maximum number of linearly independent columns in the matrix the rank of r \\(\\times\\) c matrix cannot exceed min(r, c) When a matrix is the product of two matrixs, its rank cannot exceed the smaller of the two ranks for the matrices being multiplied. 6.6 Inverse of a Matrix The inverse of a matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is another matrix, denoted by \\(\\mathbf{A^{-1}}\\), such that: \\[\\mathbf{A}^{-1}\\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{AA}^{-1} = \\mathbf{I}\\] where I is the identity matrix. the inverse of a matrix is defined only for square matrix many square matrix do not have inverse the inverse of a square matrix, if exits, is unique Finding the inverse An inverse of a square \\(r \\times r\\) matrix exists if the rank of the matrix is r. Such a matrix is said to be nonsingular or of full rank. An \\(r \\times r\\) matrix with rank less than r is said to be singular or not of full rank, and does not have an inverse. The inverse of an \\(r \\times r\\) matrix of full rank also has rank r. If: \\[\\mathbf{A}_{2 \\times 2} = \\begin{bmatrix} a &amp; b \\\\ c &amp; d \\end{bmatrix}\\] then: \\[\\mathbf{A}_{2 \\times 2}^{-1} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{d}{D} &amp; \\frac{-b}{D} \\\\ \\frac{-c}{D} &amp; \\frac{a}{D} \\end{bmatrix}\\] where: \\[D = ad - bc\\] D is called the determinant(行列式) of the matrix A. If A were singular, its determinant would equal zero and no inverse of A would exist.
